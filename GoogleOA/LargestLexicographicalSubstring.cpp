Largest Lexicographical Substring ðŸŒ¿
Given two strings A and B, your task is to output the largest lexicographically ordered substring of string B that makes string B a superstring of string A. If no such substring exists, output -1.

A superstring is a string that contains all the characters present in another string, irrespective of their order.
